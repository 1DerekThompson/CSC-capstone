# CSC-capstone

This is a program that I started developing for my CSC capstone. This is the first program where I started from scratch and researched many different concepts including creating a database and updating a database. This project allowed me to understand a little bit of PHP, HTMl5, mySQL. 

3/26/16 Currently the code adds anything into the database. In order for this to be a complete project in my eyes it must have security features to stop SQL injection, delete items in the database and increment and decrement an item already created.
